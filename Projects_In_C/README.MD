🔗 [Watch the Project Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dWvwoZclnEs?si=YnIC04PGYPEbZEyJ&t=43)

## 📌 Project Overview
**Combat Mission** is a C programming-based animation that simulates a battle scenario where a special forces soldier infiltrates an enemy camp, eliminates threats, and successfully completes his mission. The entire animation is created using **only C graphics** (graphics.h) without any external game engines or AI.

## 🚀 Features
- **Pure C Graphics Animation**: No external libraries or frameworks used.
- **18 Sequentially Rendered Scenes**: Showcasing an action-packed mission.
- **Realistic Elements**: Helicopters, parachute landings, gunfights, explosions, and mission completion sequences.
- **Modular Code Structure**: The project is divided into 6 modules for better code management and teamwork.

## 🎬 Scene Breakdown
1. Hero boards the helicopter at the helipad.
2. Helicopter flies towards the enemy camp.
3. Hero jumps and free-falls towards the enemy zone.
4. Parachute opens, and hero glides towards the ground.
5. Hero moves toward the enemy base.
6. Hero eliminates the first guard and enters the camp.
7. CCTV camera is disabled, and hero collects weapons (TNT & RPG).
8. Guards at the main tent are eliminated.
9. Alert system detects intrusion and notifies enemy control.
10. Enemy control room receives the alert.
11. Tanks (panzers) are deployed to stop the hero.
12. Tanks approach the hero.
13. Hero strategically uses TNT to destroy the tanks, completing the mission.
14. Hero moves to the extraction point.
15. **"Mission Accomplished"** text appears.
16. Credits section displaying **"Project By"**.
17. Team members' names are displayed.
18. **"The End"** is shown on the screen.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The project is divided into six modules to manage different aspects of the animation effectively. Each module was distributed among teammates, and final integration was handled by **Team Lead: Y. Mahanth**.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: `graphics.h`
- **IDE**: Turbo C++ / Code::Blocks (with graphics support)

## 📜 How to Run the Project
1. Install Turbo C++ or Code::Blocks with MinGW graphics support.
2. Include the `graphics.h` library in your compiler setup.
3. Compile and run the main program file.
4. The animation will start automatically.

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Developed a full animation using only C graphics**.
- **Structured and modularized code for team collaboration**.
- **Successfully implemented smooth scene transitions and realistic effects**.
